    <abstract>
      <t>The document discusses some deployment considerations of the various
      options to discover encrypted DNS resolvers (e.g., DNS-over-HTTPS,
      DNS-over-TLS, or DNS-over-QUIC). In particular, the document describes
      how Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) and Discovery of
      Designated Resolvers (DDR) can be used in typical deployment
      contexts.</t>

      <t>This document does not intend to provide deployment recommendations,
      but is meant to exemplify how operators can enabled the encrypted DNS
      discovery mechanisms. In addition, the document illustrates the
      feasibility of hosting encrypted DNS forwarders in Customer Premises
      Equipment (CPEs).</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-add-dnr"></xref> specifies how a local encrypted DNS
      resolver can be discovered by connected hosts by means of DHCP <xref
      target="RFC2132"></xref>, DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC8415"></xref>, and
      IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) <xref target="RFC4861"></xref> options.
      These options are designed to convey the following information: the DNS
      Authentication Domain Name (ADN), a list of IP addresses, and a set of
      service parameters. The ADN is used as a reference identifier for
      authentication purposes, while the list of IP addresses designate where
      to locate the resolver without relying upon an external resolver. The
      service parameters provide additional information to characterize a DNS
      resolver (e.g., supported encrypted DNS, customized DNS port number, or
      URI Template for DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)). Such an information is used by a
      DNS client for DNS resolver selection and session establishment.</t>

      <t>This document discusses some considerations to make use of the
      discovery of encrypted DNS resolvers such as DoH <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref>, DNS-over-TLS (DoT) <xref
      target="RFC7858"></xref>, or DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) <xref
      target="RFC9250"></xref> in local networks.</t>

      <t>Sample target deployment scenarios are discussed in <xref
      target="depl"></xref>; both managed and unmanaged Customer Premises
      Equipment (CPEs) are covered. It is out of the scope of this document to
      provide an exhaustive inventory of deployments where Encrypted DNS
      options can be used.</t>

      <t>Considerations related to hosting a DNS forwarder in a local network
      are described in <xref target="forwarder"></xref>. In contexts where
      CPEs can't be upgraded to support DNR, Discovery of Designated Resolvers
      (DDR) <xref target="I-D.ietf-add-ddr"></xref> can be used. See Sections
      <xref format="counter" target="comp"></xref> and <xref format="counter"
      target="legacy"></xref> for more details.</t>

      <t>Techniques, such as the one defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-add-encrypted-dns"></xref>, can be enabled
      together with <xref target="I-D.ietf-add-dnr"></xref> to feed the
      Encrypted DNS options. However, the document does not make any
      assumption about the internal behavior at the network side to feed the
      Encrypted DNS options that are supplied to requesting hosts; only the
      external observed behavior is detailed in the following sections.</t>

      <t>Policies to guide the activation and selection of encrypted DNS can
      be configured by users using implementation specific means (e.g., CPE
      management interface).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Scope &amp; Target Audience">
      <t>This document is not setting deployment recommendations or claiming
      to share best current practices. It is purposely scoped to exemplify how
      encrypted DNS discovery mechanisms can be enabled in typical networks. A
      set of considerations are specifically drawn to assist Internet Service
      Providers (ISPs), CPE vendors, and home network security service
      providers.</t>

      <t>Concretely, generalizing the use of encrypted DNS while preserving
      services that are offered to users (especially, those services that
      require a local DNS forwarder) depend on many actors:<list
          style="hanging">
          <t hangText="ISPs and home network security service providers:">ISPs
          who need to investigate and elaborate plans about how their managed
          CPEs will be upgraded to support encrypted DNS forwarders and
          whether home network security mechanisms will still be required to
          enforce per-device policies. <vspace blankLines="1" />Some ISPs may
          also need to investigate plans to offer encrypted DNS services even
          for CPE models whose firmware cannot be updated. For example, ISPs
          may consider updating the CPE configuration to point to the ISP's
          Do53 resolver for DDR to work.<vspace blankLines="1" />ISPs will
          also need to assess the impacts of bypassing local DNS forwarders on
          their DNS infrastructure and the services they are offering to their
          subscribers.</t>

          <t hangText="CPE vendors:">to help them assess the feasibly of CPEs
          to host an encrypted DNS forwarder. To that aim, the document
          sketches some realization approaches. For example, CPE vendors may
          learn from the effort that was conducted by some DNS providers to
          optimize the encrypted DNS forwarder to run in a container in home
          routers and how this may be integrated with home network security
          service agents.</t>

          <t hangText="Users:">may want to avoid depending on the capabilities
          of their ISP-supplied CPE. They may consider deploying an unmanaged
          CPE that uses DNR to advertise the local encrypted DNS information
          to connected devices. <xref target="forwarder_u"></xref> discusses
          how DNR can be used in such contexts.</t>

          <t hangText="OS/Application clients:">which need to support the
          Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR) <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-add-ddr"></xref> or the Discovery of
          Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-add-dnr"></xref> procedures. </t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This document is meant to assist future deployments and (hopefully)
      accelerate the network deployment of encrypted DNS servers.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="depl" title="Sample Target Deployment Scenarios">
      <t>ISPs usually provide DNS resolvers to their customers. To that aim,
      ISPs deploy the following mechanisms to advertise a list of DNS
      Recursive DNS server(s) to their customers:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Protocol Configuration Options in cellular networks <xref
          target="TS.24008"></xref>.</t>

          <t>DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC2132"></xref> (Domain Name Server Option)
          or DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC8415"></xref><xref
          target="RFC3646"></xref> (OPTION_DNS_SERVERS).</t>

          <t>IPv6 Router Advertisement <xref target="RFC4861"></xref><xref
          target="RFC8106"></xref> (Type 25 (Recursive DNS Server
          Option)).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The communication between a customer's device (possibly via a CPE)
      and an ISP-supplied DNS resolver takes place by using cleartext DNS
      messages (Do53). Some examples are depicted in cases (a) and (c) of
      <xref target="do53"></xref>. In the case of cellular networks, the
      cellular network will provide connectivity directly to a host (e.g.,
      smartphone, tablet) or via a CPE. Do53 mechanisms used within the Local
      Area Network (LAN) are similar in both fixed and cellular CPE-based
      broadband service offerings.</t>

      <t>Some ISPs rely upon external resolvers (e.g., outsourced service or
      public resolvers); these ISPs provide their customers with the IP
      addresses of these external DNS resolvers. An example is depicted in
      cases (b) and (d) of <xref target="do53"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The IP addresses of the DNS resolver can also be configured on CPEs
      using dedicated management tools. As such, users can modify the default
      DNS configuration of their CPEs (e.g., supplied by their ISP) to
      configure their favorite DNS servers. This document permits such
      deployments.</t>

      <section anchor="mcpe" title="Managed CPEs">
        <t>This section focuses on CPEs that are managed by ISPs.</t>

        <section title="Direct DNS">
          <t>ISPs have developed an expertise in managing service-specific
          configuration information (e.g., CPE WAN Management Protocol <xref
          target="TR-069"></xref>). For example, these tools may be used to
          provision the DNS server's ADN and additional service parameters to
          managed CPEs if an encrypted DNS is supported by a network similar
          to what is depicted in <xref target="wan"></xref>.</t>

          <t>For example, DoH-capable DNS clients establish the DoH session
          with the discovered DoH server.</t>

          <t>When the CPE supports DNR, the DNS client discovers whether the
          network-designated DNS resolver supports a given encrypted DNS
          scheme (e.g., DoT or DoH) by using the "alpn" service parameter
          (<xref section="3.1.5" target="I-D.ietf-add-dnr"></xref>).
          Otherwise, the DNS client uses DDR with the Do53 resolver advertised
          by the CPE and upgrades to encrypted DNS if that succeeds.
          Otherwise, the DNS client may fall back to using unencrypted DNS to
          the IP address advertised by the CPE or use some other configuration
          it has.</t>

          <t>DNR is attempted first because it requires fewer round trips to
          any network peer because all of the necessary information to use
          encrypted DNS is presented directly by the CPE. DDR requires the DNS
          client to receive Do53 resolver configuration from the CPE and then
          further query for encrypted DNS support from the DNS resolver before
          any encrypted DNS can be attempted.</t>

          relays the list of encrypted DNS resolvers that it learns from the
          network by using, e.g., DNR. Direct encrypted DNS sessions will be
          established between a host serviced by a CPE and an ISP-supplied
          encrypted DNS resolver. <xref target="direct"></xref> shows the
          example of exchanges that occur for an encrypted DNS capable host.

          <t>For all the cases shown in <xref target="proxied"></xref>, the
          CPE advertises itself as the default DNS server to the hosts it
          serves in the LAN. The CPE relies upon DHCP or RA to advertise
          itself to internal hosts as the default encrypted DNS (cases (a) and
          (c)) or Do53 resolver (cases (b) and (d)). When receiving a DNS
          request it cannot handle locally, the CPE forwards the request to an
          upstream encrypted DNS. The upstream encrypted DNS can be hosted by
          the ISP (cases (a) and (b)) or provided by a third party (cases (c)
          and (d)).</t>

          <t>Such a forwarder presence is required for IPv4 service continuity
          purposes (e.g., Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC8585"></xref>) or
          for supporting advanced services within a local network (e.g.,
          malware filtering, parental control, Manufacturer Usage Description
          (MUD) <xref target="RFC8520"></xref> to only allow intended
          communications to and from an IoT device). When the CPE behaves as a
          DNS forwarder, DNS communications can be decomposed into two
          legs:<list style="symbols">
              <t>The leg between an internal host and the CPE.</t>

              <t>The leg between the CPE and an upstream DNS resolver.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>An ISP that offers encrypted DNS to its customers may enable
          encrypted DNS in one or both legs as shown in <xref
          target="proxied"></xref>. Additional considerations related to this
          setup are discussed in <xref target="forwarder"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Customers may decide to deploy unmanaged CPEs (assuming the CPE
          is compliant with the network access technical specification that is
          usually published by ISPs). Upon attachment to the network, an
          unmanaged CPE receives from the network its service configuration
          (including the network-designated DNS information) by means of,
          e.g., DHCP. That DNS information is shared within the LAN following
          the same mechanisms as those discussed in <xref
          target="mcpe"></xref>. A host can then establish encrypted DNS
          sessions with encrypted DNS resolvers similar to what is depicted in

          <t>Absent any explicit configuration on the internal CPE to override

      <t>This section discusses some deployment considerations to host an
      encrypted DNS forwarder within a local network</t>

      <section anchor="comp" title="DDR/DNR Comparison and Naming Constraints">
        <t>DDR requires proving possession of an IP address, as the DDR
        certificate contains the server's IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and is
        signed by a certificate authority. DDR is constrained to public IP
        addresses because WebPKI certificate authorities will not sign
        special-purpose IP addresses <xref target="RFC6890"></xref>, most
        notably IPv4 private-use <xref target="RFC1918"></xref>, IPv4 shared
        address <xref target="RFC6598"></xref>, or IPv6 <xref
        target="RFC8190">Unique-Local</xref> address space. A tempting
        solution is to use the CPE's WAN IP address for DDR and prove
        possession of that IP address. However, the CPE's WAN IPv4 address
        will not be a public IPv4 address if the CPE is behind another layer
        of NAT (either Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) or another on-premise NAT),
        reducing the success of this mechanism to CPE's WAN IPv6 address. If
        the ISP renumbers the subscriber's network suddenly (rather than slow
        IPv6 renumbering described in <xref target="RFC4192"></xref>)
        encrypted DNS service will be delayed until that new certificate is
        acquired.</t>

        <t>DNR requires proving possession of an FQDN as the encrypted
        resolver's certificate contains the FQDN. The entity (e.g., ISP,
        network administrator) managing the CPE would assign a unique FQDN to
        the CPE. There are two mechanisms for the CPE to obtain the
        certificate for the FQDN: using one of its WAN IP addresses or
        requesting its signed certificate from an Internet-facing server used
        for remote CPE management (e.g., the Auto Configuration Server (ACS)
        in the CPE WAN Management Protocol <xref target="TR-069"></xref>). If
        using a CPE's WAN IP address, the CPE needs a public IPv4 or a global
        unicast IPv6 address together with DNS A or AAAA records pointing to
        that CPE's WAN address to prove possession of the DNS name to obtain a
        WebPKI CA-signed certificate (that is, the CPE fullfills the DNS or
        HTTP challenge discussed in ACME <xref target="RFC8555"></xref>).
        However, a CPE's WAN address will not be a public IPv4 address if the
        CPE is behind another layer of NAT (either a CGN or another on-premise
        NAT), reducing the success of this mechanism to a CPE's WAN IPv6
        address. If the subscribers IPv4 or IPv6 address is included in the
        certificate name (e.g., "dyn- 192-0-2-1.example.net") then DNR will
        experience IP renumbering complications identical to DDR, described
        above.</t>

        <section title="DNS Forwarders">
          <t>The managed CPE should support a configuration parameter to

          <t>Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) <xref

        <t>The unmanaged CPE administrator can host an encrypted DNS forwarder
        on the unmanaged CPE. This assumes the following:<list style="symbols">
            <t>The encrypted DNS resolver certificate is managed by the entity

            <t>The encrypted DNS forwarder will either be configured to use

        Internal CPE hosting the forwarder. The internal CPE may support a
        mechanism (e.g., <xref

        split-horizon domains (e.g., provider's private name discussed in

        in <xref target="internal_forwarded2"></xref>, the ISP uses DHCP to
        provision Do53 resolvers to managed CPEs, while DNR is enabled between
        the internal CPE and the hosts it services. The internal CPE ignores
        the DNS configuration that it receives from the managed CPE.</t>

      <t>Hosts serviced by legacy CPEs that can't be upgraded to support the
      options defined in Sections 4, 5, and 6 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-add-dnr"></xref> won't be able to learn the encrypted
      DNS resolver hosted by the ISP, in particular. If the ADN is not
      discovered using DHCP/RA, such hosts will have to fallback to use
      discovery using the resolver IP address as defined in <xref section="4"
      target="I-D.ietf-add-ddr"></xref> to discover the designated
      resolvers.</t>

      <t>The guidance in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-add-ddr"></xref> related to the designated resolver
      verification has to be followed in such a case.</t>
